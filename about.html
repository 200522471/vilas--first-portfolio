            <h3>My Passion for Computers</h3>
            <P>I always like to work on computers, Firstly when i was a kid my father bought a personal computer for his work and whenever i saw him working on a computer
                at that moment I want too to work on it, one day i go for it and started the computer and find cool things about it like we can play games on it, listen to music 
                create files and do more things that make our daily life easy and fast. 
            </P>
            <p>After that my interest in computer got increased and I started searching more about computers and new technology. then I find about codings and web development
                and programming courses to learn more about it properly </p>
